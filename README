What is it?
-----------

Getdown (yes, it's the funky stuff) aims to provide a system for downloading
and installing a collection of files on a user's machine and upgrading those
files as needed. Though just any collection of files would do, Getdown is
mainly intended for the distribution and maintenance of the collection of files
that make up an application.

See the Google Code project for documentation and other information:

Building
--------

Getdown is built with Maven in the standard ways. Invoke the following
commands, for fun and profit:

% mvn compile  # builds the classes
% mvn test     # builds and runs the unit tests
% mvn package  # builds and creates jar file
% mvn install  # builds, jars and installs in your local Maven repository
